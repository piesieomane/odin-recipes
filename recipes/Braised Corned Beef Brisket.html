    <h3><em>About Braised Corned Beef Brisket</em></h3>
        <p>You have never had corned beef like this and if you try it, I truly believe you will never go back to the traditionally 'boiled' beef.</p> 
        <p>This recipe was given to my mother-in-law during WWII by her Jewish boarding house owner and it has become a treasured family recipe
         </p>
         <p>Unlike the commonly boiled corned beef, this is a slow braise that is tender, flavorful, and has a caramelized surface when it's done.</p>

    
    <h3><em>Ingredients</em></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (5 pound) flat-cut corned beef brisket
        </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon browning sauce (such as Kitchen BouquetÂ®), or as desired</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, sliced</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        
    </ul>

    <h3><em>Steps</em></h3>

    <ol>
        <li><p>Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C)..</p></li>

        <li><p>Discard any flavoring packet from corned beef. Brush brisket with browning sauce on</p>
            <p>both sides. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat and brown</p>
            <p>brisket on both sides in the hot oil, 5 to 8 minutes per side.</p></li>

        <li><p>Place brisket on a rack set in a roasting pan. Scatter onion and garlic slices over</p>
            <p>brisket and add water to roasting pan. Cover pan tightly with aluminum foil.</p></li>

        <li><p>Roast in the preheated oven until meat is tender, about 6 hours.</p></li>
        
    </ol>
